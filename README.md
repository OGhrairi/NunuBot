## NunuBot - An experimentation with api
This Python program was written to allow me to gain some experience in working with apis.
It's in no way a fully functional application, and has absolutely no user interaction, but allows retrieval of various different pieces of data from the Riot Games api, including account information, ranked information and champion mastery information.
Further, it relies on an api key that expires every 24 hours, and a local json file with champion info/stats which is not updated automatically.
